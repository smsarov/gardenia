My first attempt in React Native development. Project is unfinished, but look quite good imo. 
The idea was to make an app where you can generate different trees and interbreed them with the ones on other users to make the most beautiful tree!

Btw, i recommend cheking out this https://editor.p5js.org/smsarov-aluminum/sketches/SsE6--L-t online editor and try to generate your own beautiful trees! It provides all sorts of different settings
